Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project: Domain-Independent Model🎯 OverviewThis repository contains the code and data used for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) project, which is initialized by fine-tuning a powerful multilingual model (xlm-roberta-base) on the standard CoNLL-2003 (English) dataset. The goal is to build an NER model that performs reliably across various topics and contexts.📁 Repository ContentsFile NameDescriptionCopy_of_conll_2002_format_NER.ipynbThe main Jupyter Notebook detailing the data preparation, model loading, training pipeline, and evaluation logic.train.txtThe Training split of the CoNLL-2003 NER dataset.valid.txtThe Validation/Development split.test.txtThe Test split.🛑 The Main Issue: Domain DependencyThe model, trained primarily on news data (CoNLL-2003), currently exhibits significant domain dependency.The core problem is that the model fails to correctly identify entities in a domain-independent setting, which includes common, real-world examples outside of the training corpus’s specific context.Example InputDesired EntityCurrent Model Failure"My name is Rishabh."Rishabh as B-PER (Person)Often tags Rishabh as O (Outside) or B-MISC."...lives in India."India as B-LOC (Location)Fails to recognize the location outside of typical news context.We need to fix this generalization issue to ensure that if a proper noun is a Person, Location, or Organization, it is recognized as such, regardless of the surrounding text's topic.📈 Plan for Improvement (Making it Better)To achieve a higher-quality, more domain-independent NER system, we will focus on data diversification and model robustness.1. Data Augmentation and ExpansionWe will make the dataset "more better" by adding diversity beyond the news domain:Integrate New Datasets: Introduce additional training data from different domains (e.g., social media, Wikipedia, financial reports, or biomedical texts) to make the model less biased towards news language.Data Quality Check: Ensure all new datasets adhere strictly to the BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) tagging scheme and the standard entity types (PER, LOC, ORG, MISC).2. Model & Training EnhancementsLeverage XLM-RoBERTa's Multilingual Strengths: Explore adding CoNLL-2002 (Spanish/Dutch) data to further improve the model's cross-lingual and general language understanding, which indirectly boosts domain independence.Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematically test different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings to find the optimal configuration that minimizes overfitting to the training domain.Advanced Regularization: Use techniques like higher dropout rates or weight decay to force the model to learn more generalized, essential features rather than relying on superficial, domain-specific cues.
